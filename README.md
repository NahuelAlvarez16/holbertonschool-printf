# My Printf

In this project we have created a function for simple printing and also for printing specific formats. This function works just like the original printf function from the stdio.h library.


# How does it work?
The printf prints a string and substitutes any specific formatting it may have for its assigned contents.

## Examples

	_printf("Hi!! My name is %s\n", "Printf");
	_printf("my age is %d\n", num);
